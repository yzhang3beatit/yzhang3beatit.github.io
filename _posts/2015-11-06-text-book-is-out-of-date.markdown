The weather turned nice today.The sun came out.

This week we start a course, Linux, and we have our first class today.Now, I have been using this operating system for about four years, and already knew everything the teacher was going to teach.He seemed unhappy but still said yes. 

Actually, I was in his class two years ago, aka, my first year in college.I didn't select this course formally, but was just interested.Linux is interesting but his class was really boring.Today I even found that he uses the same ppt as two years ago!Jesus, now we already have windows 10 and he was still talking about windows XP and 7!

What's more, our textbook has already been in use for 10 years, I think.Because a lot of awesome IDE software has come and gone, we are still learning VC.Compared to that, the out-of-date ppt was not a big deal.

Anyway, in my opinion, most teachers in campus have no experience about development. If you are really interested in something, just go to the library and pick a book.You are on your way.
