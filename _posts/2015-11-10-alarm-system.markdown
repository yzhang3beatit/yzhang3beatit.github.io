Today I met my tutor.He said he had bought two TVs for showing daily notice.They were very expensive, so he asked me if I could program an alarm system for them.He wants an alarm to go off if someone touches the TV.I thought it would be easy if I made it with raspberry Pi, so I said "yes."

I ordered two buzzers when I got back home. I had an awesome idea! What if the alarm could send an email with a photo when anyone touches the TV? I decided to make the alarm program with raspberry Pi, using python programming language. The code was easy for me to write and within 2 hours, I finished the project.

Programming is amazing!
