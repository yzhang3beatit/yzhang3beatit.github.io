The rain has stopped today, the weather turns cold and still I can't see the sun.

November 2nd  was the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Boole, the man who influenced the boolean variables which are almost used in every computer language today.On November 2nd 2015, Google changed its logo in memory of him.Today I read a blog about him, and found that most of his knowledge was achieved through self-learning!

Now I am going to get some sleep, tomorrow is going to be a busy day.
