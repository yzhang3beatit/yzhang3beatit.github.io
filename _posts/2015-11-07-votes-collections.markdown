Shanghai's weather was so damn bad.It was rainy AGAIN!

Today I have watched a movie named NO Half Measures.It's a documentary about creating the final season of Breaking Bad(I really love this series).

In the afternoon I did nothing but write code.There was a bug that took me almost 3 hours to fix.

In the evening, I played table tennis with a friend from Pakistan.After that, he told me that they had taken part in a competition on Culture Festival in our university, and they should go to collect the votes from passerby. I decided to help him.It's super easy.It was kind of weird to speak English to my native schoolmates(Because I am with my international friends). 

When we stopped collecting, Pakistan was still in the first place, and had 600 more votes than the second. I hope they win.
